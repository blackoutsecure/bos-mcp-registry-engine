## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please open a private security advisory through GitHub:

- [Create a private security advisory](https://github.com/blackoutsecure/bos-mcp-registry-engine/security/advisories/new)

If private advisory flow is unavailable, open an issue with minimal details and request secure follow-up:

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/blackoutsecure/bos-mcp-registry-engine/issues)

## Disclosure Process

- We acknowledge reports as quickly as possible.
- We validate impact and scope before publishing details.
- We release a fix and publish advisory notes when remediation is available.

## Security Best Practices

- Pin action versions in production workflows.
- Keep dependencies updated.
- Validate registry outputs in CI before deployment.
